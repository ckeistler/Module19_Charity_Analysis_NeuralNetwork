# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

  
## Results

#### Data Preprocessing

  -What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  
  -What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  
  -What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
 
  
#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

  -How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  
  -Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  
  -What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
