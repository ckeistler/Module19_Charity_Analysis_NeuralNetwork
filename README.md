# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
  
With our module 19 content, covering machine learning and neural networks, we use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
  
## Results

#### Data Preprocessing

  -What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  
  -What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  
  -What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
 
  
#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

  -How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  
  -Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  
  -What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
