# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
  
With our module 19 content, covering machine learning and neural networks, we use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

#### Data Preprocessing

  -What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  
  -What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  
  -What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
 
#### Deliverable 2
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, you’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. You’ll need to think about how many inputs there are before determining the number of neurons and layers in your model. Once you’ve completed that step, you’ll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

  -How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  
  -Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  
  -What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
